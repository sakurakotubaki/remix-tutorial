# Build an app with Remix and Bun
https://bun.sh/guides/ecosystem/remix

Initialize a Remix app with create-remix.
```bash
bun create remix
```

To start the dev server, run bun run dev from the project root. This will start the dev server using the remix dev command. Note that Node.js will be used to run the dev server.
```bash
cd my-app
bun run dev
```
